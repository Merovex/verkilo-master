## Series Outline

The SERIES OUTLINE is a self contained document of 1-2 pages that overviews character and narrative arcs over the course of the series; including central tension. Much like a feature-film Treatment it focuses on the major plot events and the journey of the protagonists.

<!-- _**a one-page (4-5 paragraph) summary of the world, major characters and central tension.**_

Write an overview of the series idea, describing the world or setting it takes place in, the unique conflicts faced, and the dynamics between main characters that fuel the story. This is a great sales tool because you're going to highlight the most interesting facets and themes of the series. You should be able to do this in three paragraphs, but a few pages is ok so long as the writing is "tight" and reads efficiently, moving the story beat by beat. -->

<!-- Looking at PoI's formatting https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_Interest_(TV_series) -->

1. Paragraph introduces the main character and the central series plot.
2. Paragraph explains the major characters & relationships to main character and one-another.
3. Paragraph summarizes major series sub-plots, one sentence per subplot. Highlight on the first major subplot to address.
4. Paragraph of season two summary in four sentences: the core season conflict, new characters/conflicts. Service the subplots.
5. Ditto each new season. Close each subplot introduced in the sub-plot paragraph. Introduce a new one as necessary.
