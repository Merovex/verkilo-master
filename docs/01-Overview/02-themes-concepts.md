## Themes & Concepts

THEMES are Unifying Subjects

Themes provide the idea-space the production and story will play out in and which will unify otherwise disparate storylines and characters.

Themes shouldn’t present arguments or perspectives but rather be the macro-level topic to be explored. It provides a touchstone of reference for any given episode -

"How does each episode, each character explore the themes?”

Love, Justice, Revenge, Redemption, Betrayal, Hope, Progress, Power, Corruption… Big dynamic emotive words make great themes for unifying a series.

CONCEPTS represent the ‘what if’ questions of your series. Strong concepts are often the result of bringing together things that otherwise don’t belong, or scenarios that are extraordinary in some way as to prompt questions on the mind of an audience.
